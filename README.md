# Random Forest Classifier Training Script

This project demonstrates how AWS services are utilized throughout a machine learning workflow using a Random Forest Classifier. It covers model training, evaluation, and deployment, showcasing integration with AWS services for a streamlined and scalable approach.

## Project Overview

This script is designed to:

1. **Read training and testing data** from CSV files.
2. **Train a Random Forest Classifier** using the specified hyperparameters.
3. **Evaluate the model** using accuracy and other classification metrics.
4. **Save the trained model** to a specified directory.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `joblib`
- `boto3` (optional, for AWS integration)
